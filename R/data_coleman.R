#' A simulated species-site abundance matrix with site areas

#' A dataset in the correct mmSAR2 format:

#' @usage data(cole_sim)
#' @format A list with two elements. The first element contains a species-site
#'   abundance matrix in which the rows are species, and the columns are
#'   sites/islands. Each value in the matrix is the abundance of a species at a
#'   given site. The second element contains a vector of the areas of each site.
