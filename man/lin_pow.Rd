\title{Fit the log-log version of the power model}
\usage{
lin_pow(data, con = 1, logT = log, compare = FALSE, normaTest =
  "lillie", homoTest = "cor.fitted")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset in the form of a dataframe with two columns: the first
with island/site areas, and the second with the species richness of each
island/site.}

\item{con}{The constant to add to the species richness values in cases where
one of the islands has zero species.}

\item{logT}{The log-transformation to apply to the area and richness values.
Can be any of \code{log}(default), \code{log2} or \code{log10}.}

\item{compare}{Fit the standard (non-linear) power model and return the
z-value for comparison (default: \code{compare = FALSE}).}

\item{normaTest}{The test used to test the normality of the residuals of the
model. Can be any of "lillie" (Lilliefors Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; the
default), "shapiro" (Shapiro-Wilk test of normality), "kolmo"
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), or "none" (no residuals normality test is
undertaken).}

\item{homoTest}{The test used to check for homogeneity of the residuals of
the model. Can be any of "cor.fitted" (a correlation of the residuals with
the model fitted values; the default), "cor.area" (a correlation of the
residuals with the area values), or "none" (no residuals homogeneity test
is undertaken).}
}
\value{
A list of class "sars" with up to seven elements. The first element
  is an object of class 'summary.lm'. This is the summary of the linear model
  fit using the \link[stats]{lm} function and the user's data. The second
  element is a numeric vector of the model's fitted values, and the third
  contains the log-transformed observed data. The remaining elements depend
  on the function arguments selected and can include the results of the
  non-linear power model fit, the log-transformation function used (i.e.
  \code{logT}) and the results of the residuals normality and heterogeneity
  tests.

  The \code{\link{summary.sars}} function returns a more useful summary of
  the model fit results, and the \code{\link{plot.sars}} plots the model.
}
\description{
Fit the log-log version of the power model to SAR data and
  return parameter values, summary statistics and the fitted values.
}
\details{
A check is made for any islands with zero species. If any zero
  species islands are found, a constant (default: \code{con = 1}) is added
  to each species richness value to enable log transformation. Natural
  logarithms are used as default, but log2 and log10 can be used instead
  using the \code{logT} argument.

  The \code{compare} argument can be used to compare the c and z values
  calculated using the log-log power model with that calculated using the
  non-linear power model. Note that the log-log function returns log(c).
