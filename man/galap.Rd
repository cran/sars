\title{A SAR dataset describing the plants of the Galapagos Islands}
\format{Adata frame with 2 columns and 16 rows. Each row contains the area of
  an island (km2) in the Galapagos (1st column) and the number of plants on
  that island (2nd column).Preston (1962) also includes the island of
  Albemarle, but we have excluded this as it is almost six times larger than
  the second largest island.}
