\title{Summarising the results of the model fitting functions}
\usage{
\method{summary}{sars}(object, order = "BIC", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'sars'.}

\item{order}{The information criterion used to order the model summary table
for objects of Type 'threshold' (Default = "BIC").}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
The \code{summary.sars} function returns an object of class
  "summary.sars". A print function is used to obtain and print a summary
  of the model fit results.

  For a 'sars' object of Type 'fit', a list with 16 elements is returned
  that contains useful information from the model fit, including the model
  parameter table (with t-values, p-values and confidence intervals),
  model fit statistics (e.g. R2, AIC), the observed shape of the model and
  whether or not the fit is asymptotic, and the results of any additional
  model checks undertaken (e.g. normality of the residuals).

  For a 'sars' object of Type 'multi', a list with 4 elements is returned:
  (i) a vector of the names of the models that were successfully fitted
  and passed any additional checks, (ii) a character string containing the
  name of the criterion used to rank models, (iii) a data frame of the
  ranked models, and (iv) a vector of the names of any models that were
  not fitted or did not pass any additional checks. In regards to (iii;
  \code{Model_table}), the dataframe contains the fit summaries for each
  successfully fitted model (including the value of the model criterion
  used to compare models, the R2 and adjusted R2, and the observed shape
  of the fit); the models are ranked in decreasing order of information
  criterion weight.

  For a 'sars' object of Type 'lin_pow', a list with up to 7 elements is
  returned: (i) the model fit output from the \code{\link{lm}} function, (ii)
  the fitted values of the model, (iii) the observed data, (iv and v) the
  results of the residuals normality and heterogeneity tests, and (vi) the
  log-transformation function used. If the argument \code{compare = TRUE} is
  used in \code{\link{lin_pow}}, a 7th element is returned that contains the
  parameter values from the non-linear power model.
  
  For a 'sars' object of Type 'threshold', a list with three elements is
  returned: (i) the information criterion used to order the ranked model
  summary table ('order'), (ii) a model summary table (models are ranked
  using the 'order' argument), and (iii) details of any axes
  log-transformations undertaken. Note that in the model summary table, if
  log-area is used as the predictor, the threshold values will be on the log
  scale used. Thus it may be preferable to back-transform them (e.g. using
  \code{exp(th)} if natural logarithms are used) so that they are on the
  scale of untransformed area. Th1 and Th2 in the table are the threshold
  value(s), and seg1, seg2, seg3 provide the number of datapoints within each
  segment (for the threshold models); one-threshold models have two
  segements, and two-threshold models have three segments.

\description{
S3 method for class 'sars'. \code{summary.sars} creates
  summary statistics for objects of class 'sars'. The exact summary
  statistics computed depends on the 'Type' attribute (e.g. 'multi') of
  the 'sars' object. The summary method generates more useful information
  for the user than the standard model fitting functions. Another S3
  method (\code{print.summary.sars}; not documented) is used to print the
  output.
