\title{Fit threshold SAR models}
\usage{
sar_threshold(data, mod = "All", interval = NULL, nisl = NULL,
  non_th_models = TRUE, logAxes = "area", con = 1, logT = log, parallel =
  FALSE, cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset in the form of a dataframe with at least two columns:
the first with island/site areas, and the second with the species richness
of each island/site.}

\item{mod}{A vector of model names: an individual model, a set of models, or
all models. Can be any of 'All' (fit all models), 'ContOne' (continuous
one-threshold), 'ZslopeOne' (left-horizontal one-threshold), 'DiscOne'
(discontinuous one-threshold), 'ContTwo' (continuous two-threshold),
'ZslopeTwo' (left-horizontal two-threshold), or 'DiscTwo' (discontinuous
two-threshold).}

\item{interval}{The amount to increment the threshold value by in the
iterative model fitting process (not applicable for the discontinuous
models). The default for non-transformed area reverts to 1, while for
log-transformed area it is 0.01. However, these values may not be suitable
depending on the range of area values in a dataset, and thus users are
advised to manually set this argument.}

\item{nisl}{Set the minimum number of islands to be contained within each of
the two segments (in the case of one-threshold models), or the first and
last segments (in the case of two-threshold models). It needs to be less
than than half of the total number of islands in the dataset. Default =
NULL.}

\item{non_th_models}{Logical argument (default = TRUE) of whether two
non-threshold models (i.e. a simple linear regression: y ~ x; and an
intercept only model: y ~ 1) should also be fitted.}

\item{logAxes}{What log-transformation (if any) should be applied to the area
and richness values. Should be one of "none" (no transformation), "area"
(only area is log-transformed; default) or "both" (both area and richness
log-transformed).}

\item{con}{The constant to add to the species richness values in cases where
one of the islands has zero species.}

\item{logT}{The log-transformation to apply to the area and richness values.
Can be any of \code{log}(default), \code{log2} or \code{log10}.}

\item{parallel}{Logical argument for whether parallel processing should be
used. Only applicable when the continuous two-threshold and left-horizontal
two-threshold models are being fitted.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores to use. Only applicable when \code{parallel =
TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of class "threshold" and "sars" with five elements. The first
  element contains the different model fits (lm objects). The second element
  contains the names of the fitted models, the third  contains the threshold
  values, the fourth element the dataset (i.e. a dataframe with area and
  richness values), and the fifth contains details of any axes
  log-transformations undertaken. \code{\link{summary.sars}} provides a more
  user-friendly ouput (including a model summary table) and
  \code{\link{plot.threshold}} plots the model fits.

\description{
Fit up to six piecewise (threshold) regression models to SAR
  data.
}
\details{
This function is described in more detail in the accompanying paper
  (Matthews & Rigal, 2020).

  Fitting the continuous and left-horizontal piecewise models (particularly
  the two-threshold models) can be time consuming if the range in area is
  large and/or the \code{interval} argument is small. For the two-threshold
  continuous slope and left-horizontal models, the use of parallel processing
  (using the \code{parallel} argument) is recommended. The number of cores
  (\code{cores}) must be provided.

  Note that the interval argument is not used to fit discontinuous models,
  as, in these cases, the breakpoint must be at a datapoint.

  There has been considerable debate regarding the number of parameters that
  are included in different piecewise models. Here (and thus in our
  calculation of AIC, AICc, BIC etc) we consider ContOne to have five
  parameters, ZslopeOne - 4, DiscOne - 6, ContTwo - 7, ZslopeTwo - 6, DiscTwo
  - 8. The standard linear model and the intercept model are considered to
  have 3 and 2 parameters, respectively. The raw \code{\link{lm}} model fits
  are provided in the output, however, if users want to calculate information
  criteria using different numbers of parameters.
  
  The raw \code{\link{lm}} model fits can also be used to explore classic
  diagnostic plots for linear regression analysis in R using the function
  \code{\link{plot}} or other diagnostic tests such \code{outlierTest},
  \code{leveragePlots} or \code{influencePlot}, available in the \code{car}
  package. This is advised as currently there are no model validation checks
  undertaken automatically, unlike elsewhere in the sars package. 
  
  Confidence intervals around the breakpoints in the one-threshold continuous
  and left- horizontal models can be calculated using the
  \code{\link{threshold_ci}} function. The intercepts and slopes of the
  different segments in the fitted breakpoint models can be calculated using
  the \code{\link{get_coef}} function.
  
  Rarely, multiple breakpoint values can return the same minimum rss (for a
  given model fit). In these cases, we just randomly choose and return one
  and also produce a warning. If this occurs it is worth checking the data
  and model fits carefully.
  
  The \code{nisl} argument can be useful to avoid situations where a segment
  contains only one island, for example. However, setting strict criteria on
  the number of data points to be included in segments could be seen as
  "forcing" the fit of the model, and arguably if a model fit is not
  interpretable, it is simply that the model does not provide a good
  representation of the data. Thus, it should not be used without careful
  thought.
}
\note{
Due to the increased number of parameters, fitting piecewise regression
  models to datasets with few islands is not recommended. In particular, we
  would advise against fitting the two-threshold models to small SAR datasets
  (e.g. fewer than 10 islands for the one threshold models, and 20 islands
  for the two threshold models).

data(aegean2)
a2 <- aegean2[1:168,]
fitT <- sar_threshold(data = a2, mod = c("ContOne", "DiscOne"), 
interval = 0.1, non_th_models = TRUE, logAxes = "area", logT = log10)
summary(fitT)
plot(fitT)
#diagnostic plots for the ContOne model
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))

#Plot multiple model fits in the same plot, with different colour for each 
#model fit
plot(fitT, multPlot = FALSE, lcol = c("yellow", "red", "green", "purple"))
#Making a legend. First extract the model order:
fitT[[2]]
#Then use the legend function - note you may need to play around with the 
#legend location depending on your data.
