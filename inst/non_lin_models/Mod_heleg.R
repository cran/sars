#LOGISTIC FUNCTION (HE & LEGENDRE 1996)
#doesn't make sense to fit negative relationships with this
#model, so pars should be Rplus.
#Tjorve's table in book chapter says asymptote par of Archibald logistic
#is the c parameter in ours, but have checked and we are correct with c/f.
#Table 3 of Tjorve (2009) states its shape is sigmoid but "only the convex
#part is used", and Williams (2009) discusses it being sigmoid but in logA
#space. We've found it can give both shapes in untransformed space, so
#have classified it as convex/sigmoid.
#Found to be equivalent to mmf and the latter deprecated.
#nb. Tjorve (2009) has a mistake in their formula for this model (Archibald
#logistic), and give corrected version in the sar book chapter
