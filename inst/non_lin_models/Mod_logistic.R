#Standard Logistic function
#Formula given in Tjorve (2003)
#d confirmed as asymptote in Tjorve (2003)
#Starting parameter method taken from:
#https://bscheng.com/2014/05/07/modeling-logistic-growth-data-in-r/
#Shape given as sigmoid, but it can have observed shapes of linear, convex up
#and convex down. 
#Pars all set to Rplus, similar to heleg and mmf. d has to be as is the 
#asymptote, and have tested the other two - z should be Rplus but with c it is
#trickier. For some datasets, setting c to R results in a better fit, but then 
#this also means for other datasets it converges on a worse fit. Having it as
#Rplus seems to allow it to better fit the "typical" sigmoid shape so have left
#it as that for now.
